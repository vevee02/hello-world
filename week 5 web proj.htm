<h2>Why I chose Cal State LA</h2>
<p>I feel fortunate enough to have the opportunity to come to a 4 year university. I chose Cal State LA because tuition is affordable and it has everything I need to succeed in my academics. I love the campus environment around me. I made a lot of friends and have the opportunity to build a lot of connections. </p>
<p>Here are three things about me:</p>
<p> 1. I am a freshman at Cal State LA</p>
<p> 2. I am majoring in Computer Science</p>
<p> 3. I take the bus to school everyday.</p>
